                    <p style="margin-left: 2mm;">
                        Hello, internet traveller, and welcome to my website! This is a place for me to collect my hobbyist coding projects.
                        It is all entirely my own work; the projects as well as all the web design.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 2mm;">
                        My projects are mostly just a bit of fun; making computers do cool things or to make tools to make life slightly easier.
                        Mixed in are also some projects which I've done as part of my degree.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 2mm;">
                        I'm a 4th year at Somerville College, Oxford, studying Engineering Science. I specialise in software/computer engineering,
                        as well as civil/geotechnic engineering. I'm known around the internet as "dapeef".
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 2mm;">
                        Outside of my degree I play bass trombone, ring church bells and play pool/snooker with the university.
                        I'm also a member of Oxford University Air Squadron, an RAF volunteer reserve organisation for university students.

                                I built it myself from the bottom up; my other websites are based on the same basic framework.

                                This project was motivated by repeated complaints from my chemist friends having to create a COSHH (Control Of Substances Hazardous to Health)
                                form for each of their experiments. Their previous work flow required searching a chemical database website
                                (<a target="_blank" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a>) for their chemical, scrolling
                                to find the hazards, then writing them out manually (the website disallowed copy and paste).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My response "surely it can be automated" was met with "no, this is the only way". That was enough motivation...
                            </p>

                            <div class="mini_header">Solution</div>

                                <a target="_blank" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a>'s APIs; their search API is used to get the chemical's
                                unique ID, which is then used in a request to <a target="_blank" href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a>'s main API
                                to get in-depth information about the chemical. This information is then parsed to extract the hazard information, as well as
                                other useful information like boiling point and molecular weight. My site further processes the hazard codes, removing redundant
                                codes (for example, rejecting "Causes skin irritation" when "Causes serious skin irritation" is also present).

                                This software was made as part of my 3rd year engineering group project. The brief was to "Create a multi-agent drone system". My group
                                chose to create a sheep herding system; it's a novel and relatively unresearched area, and I also have a personal interest (we own sheep).
                            </p>

                            <div class="mini_header">Simulation environment</div>
                            <p>
                                Part of my role in this project was to create a simulation environment to predict the sheep's response to drones.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Initially, the drone path planning algorithm was planned to be a reinforcement learnt algorithm,
                                which would require a large dataset. The simulation would act as an infinite dataset for the algorithm
                                to train with; new data could be generated on-demand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even after the reinforcement learning strategy was dismissed, a simulation environment was still
                                required to validate the drone path planning algorithms, particularly because we had no access to
                                any real sheep for this purpose.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The simulation was also helpful to train/test the image processing algorithms; a dataset could be created by saving the screen
                                as well as a list of sheep positions.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                My other role was to create a user interface through which a farmer might control the drone herding process.
                                Special care was taken to make the HRI as intuitive as possible.
                            </p>

                                A functional HRI was created using PyQt5 [110] in conjunction with Google's Maps API [111], using
                                1240 lines of code (814 Python, 378 JavaScript and 48 HTML).

                                As well as sheep, we have chickens. It's a nuisance to have to repeatedly check during the day whether there are eggs ready for collection;
                                this tool was designed to combat that issue. As well as that, this tool could be expanded to identify which chicken has laid which egg -
                                more on that in the "Further development section".
                            </p>

                            <div class="mini_header">Solution</div>
                            <p>
                                This tool takes advantage of a digital weighing scale connected to a Raspberry Pi which can be fitted underneath the egg collection area.
                                All eggs laid in the nesting box roll into the egg collection area, causing a step change in weight recorded by the scales.
                                This step can be recorded and measured to identify the timestamp and mass of the egg.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This information can then be accessed via an HTML front end hosted by the Raspberry Pi. This means that the site can be accessed
                                from outside the house, with the port forwarding and DNS settings configured.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I'd like to expand this project to include an RFID sensor in the nesting box, in conjuction with RFID leg bands on the chickens, to detect
                                which chicken lays which eggs. This would prove useful to detect which chickens are off lay or ill, leading to improved flock management.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It would also be nice to integrate an programmable pop-hole closing system, handled by the same Raspberry Pi. The chickens need to be let
                                out near sunrise, which gets particularly early during the summer; this tool would allow the door to be opened at a preprogrammed time
                                (or be triggered by a light sensor), removing the need to wake up so early. This could also be used in
                                conjuction with a couple of RFID sensors to ensure all chickens are inside the house before the door is closed for the night.
                            </p>
